LED Clock implemented with Particle Photon.

Uses two Neopixel rings to make a clock: a 60 segment one for minutes and seconds, and a 24 segment one for the hour.

Currently has two "faces" with different time telling styles.

Includes a 24 segment and 7 segement LED showing the temperature via web API.
